## Team Members:

## 🚀 Overview
Astro-Shift is a modern take on the classic 1979 Atari arcade game, *Asteroids*, featuring enhanced visuals and innovative gameplay mechanics. Players pilot a spaceship, dodging and destroying asteroids while contending with a challenging **Gravity Switch** mechanic. Destroyed asteroids drop coins that can be used to upgrade weapons and unlock new abilities.

## 🎮 Core Features
- **Gravity Switch Mechanic** – After a random delay, a countdown appears on screen. Once the countdown reaches zero, a gravitational field is activated for a brief period. During this phase, asteroids pull on each other and on the spaceship, forcing players to quickly reposition their ship away from dense clusters.
- **Newtonian Physics** – Experience authentic inertia-based space movement.
- **Upgradable Weapons** – Earn coins from destroyed asteroids to upgrade your weapons and boost your firepower.
- **Endless Survival Mode** – Face an ever-increasing challenge with rising asteroid density and unpredictable gravitational shifts.
- **Retro Aesthetic** – Enjoy pixel-inspired graphics updated with modern visual enhancements.

## 🕹️ Controls
- **Rotate Left/Right**: Arrow Keys (←/→) or A/D
- **Thrust**: Up Arrow (↑) or W
- **Fire**: Spacebar
- **Open Upgrade Menu**: B
