## 🚀 Overview
Astro-Shift is a modern take on the classic 1979 Atari arcade game, *Asteroids*, with enhanced visuals and unique gameplay mechanics. Players control a spaceship, dodging and destroying asteroids while leveraging the **Gravity Switch** mechanic to manipulate asteroid movement. Destroyed asteroids drop coins, which can be used to upgrade weapons and unlock new abilities.

## 🎮 Core Features
- **Gravity Switch Mechanic** – Temporarily reverses gravitational pull, clustering or dispersing asteroids dynamically.
- **Newtonian Physics** – Classic inertia-based space movement.
- **Upgradable Weapons** – Collect coins from destroyed asteroids to purchase and enhance weapons.
- **Endless Survival Mode** – Increasing difficulty with asteroid density, enemy fire, and environmental hazards.
- **Retro Aesthetic** – Pixel-inspired graphics with modern enhancements.

## 🕹️ Controls
- **Rotate Left/Right**: Arrow Keys (←/→) or A/D
- **Thrust**: Up Arrow (↑) or W
- **Fire**: Spacebar
- **Activate Gravity Switch**: Shift Key
- **Open Upgrade Menu**: Q
